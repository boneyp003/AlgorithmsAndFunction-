# AlgorithmsAndFunction
My purpose of making this repository is to practice some small problem solving interview questions and keep a track of my work for reference. I intend to do major of my development using JavaScript as it is very convenient. Also, the only tool you need here will be web browser for testing purposes.
However, I am happy to share this with other.
